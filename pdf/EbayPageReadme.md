### The Switch Node is a low cost wireless Arduino IDE compatible (the Atmel ATMega328P) microcontroller with RFM 69 CW 433 MHz radio on board and build in hardware debouncer. Best sutable for Home Automation, IOT. Could be used as switch board for radio controlling any DIY project.

## Features
- Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE (PRO MINI 8 MG Hz)
- Over the Air, firmware updates (OTA) ready. In combination with preprogrammed Dual Optiboot boot loader and External JDEC  EPROM\Flash memory chip on board the Node allows OTA software updates.
- Onboard RFM69 CW 433 MHz Radio Transceiver  with wire antenna
- Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip makes communication with the Node very secured. ATSHA204A implements secured handshake and if handshake fails the Node will not executing any command sent to it
- Programming header is FTDI, TTL Serial. For programming you need to have  USB TTL Serial – FTDI adaptor
- ENIG Emersion Gold finish
- MySensors compatible. You can use superb set of scripts and libraries from [mysensors.org](http://www.mysensors.org) project  and convert the node into reliable network of little home sensors, relays and actuators.
- Battery connector CR2450
- Yes, it is open sourced. Completely.

Comes with Arduino example sketch and guide to IOT ideas.
