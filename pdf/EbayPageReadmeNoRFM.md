### The ButtonSize Node is a low cost Arduino IDE compatible (the Atmel ATMega328P) microcontroller. Ready RFM 69 CW or HW radio on board. Build in Temperature, Humidity and Light sensors. Best suitable for Home Automation, IOT. The board can be used as universal sensor board for radio controlling any DIY project.

## Features
- Fully compatible with the Arduino IDE (PRO MINI 8 MG Hz)
- Dimensions 42.2mm x 20.9mm or if you cut sensor part of the board it is just 20.9mm x 20.9mm
- Temperature and humidity sensor Si7021
- Light sensor BH1750, spectral responsibility is approximately human eye response.
- Over the Air, firmware updates (OTA) ready. In combination with preprogrammed Dual Optiboot boot loader and External JDEC EPROM\Flash memory chip on board the Node allows OTA software updates.
- Ready for RFM69-HW or CW (via with PCB adapter) Radio transceiver with wire antenna
- Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip makes communication with the Node very secured. ATSHA204A implements secured handshake and if handshake fails the Node will not executing any command sent to it
- Programming header is FTDI, TTL Serial. For programming, you need to have USB TTL Serial – FTDI adaptor
- ENIG Emersion Gold finish
- MySensors compatible. You can use superb set of scripts and libraries from [mysensors.org](http://www.mysensors.org) project  and convert the node into reliable network of little home sensors, relays and actuators.
- Battery connector CR2032 
- You can cut with scissors, sensors and battery holder part of the board, if you need just controller and radio
- Yes, it is open sourced. Completely

Comes with Arduino example sketch and guide to IOT, Smart home ideas.

## If you plan to use the Node battery powered
You need CW version radio on board. HW version is longer range but will eat battery pretty fast though. Please send me message stating which radio type you need in your order.

## Overview
If you are familiar with Arduino boards, the ButtonSize Node is Arduino pro Mini with onboard HopeRF RFM69-CW or HW 433 MHz radio, external EPROM flash and crypto authentication chip. To save some board dimensions the ButtonSize Node does not have onboard USB-Serial converter. You need to buy FTDI Adapter for programming. HopeRF RFM69-HW provide extremely good range. HopeRF RFM69-CW version will have half of that range but still many hundred meters in open area. External Flash chip allows burning Arduino sketch wirelessly. Onboard Atmel ATSHA204A CryptoAuthentication chip secures communication with other controllers.
