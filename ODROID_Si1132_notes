1. Remove ALS_AUTO command in the initialization code. 
2. Issue ALS_FORCE command every time the host wants to take a measurement
3. The delay time depends on your configuration and how often the host wants to take a measurement. Normally, 5ms ~ 10ms is more than enough.

Comment out this line of code as you're using forced mode: write8(Si1132_REG_MEASRATE0, 0xFF). Leave MEASRATE to 0.
Also, you don't need to call write8(Si1132_REG_COMMAND, Si1132_ALS_PAUSE) in forced mode.


boolean ODROID_Si1132::begin(void)

	//write8(Si1132_REG_MEASRATE0, 0xFF);
	//write8(Si1132_REG_COMMAND, Si1132_ALS_AUTO);



uint16_t ODROID_Si1132::readUV()
{
	write8(Si1132_REG_COMMAND, Si1132_ALS_FORCE);
	delay(10);
	return read16(0x2c);
}
